# bridge-vibration-monitoring
This project demonstrates structural health monitoring (SHM) of the Nzoia Bridge using low-cost wireless vibration sensors and signal processing via Python. Accelerometer data was collected using an MPU9250 sensor and Arduino, then analyzed using Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) to assess frequency response and potential resonance risk.
